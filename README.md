# tessle-uart-adapter

## installation
```console
git clone git@github.com:jden/tessel-uart-adapter.git
cd tessel-uart-adapter
npm install
node console
```

## usage
it's a really half-baked implementation of a terminal emulator for connecting
to serial ports via uart. I made this at Node Bots Day SF '14 for debugging a
robot.
